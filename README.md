# AI usage
Explain how you use the AI to solve the assignment. Put all ***your used queries*** in this section & what kind of AI are you using. Declare not using AI if you didn't do this. 

i used gemini 2.5 pro to help me create the application and integrate the algorithm from deberg book's to qt.
here's the prompt that i used (it's not the exact prompt because my gemini chat history for this assignment got deleted):
1. create me a code that creates application in qt that have 4 files, which is drawingwindow.h drawingcanvas.h drawingwindow.cpp drawingcanvas.cpp. the user must be able to click and draw a point on the canvas. there also needs to be a button that draws a line between the points when pressed, and a button clear that clears all points and line when pressed
2. integrate this python slow convex hull and fast convex hull detection code to qt, make two button for each detection, and when the button is pressed the algorithm is performed
3. fix the code, when the button is pressed the convex hull still not created
4. add in the code to show how many iteration the algo takes in the canvas

# Collaboration usage
Explain how you are ***using others*** to complete the assignment in this section. Are they simply copying, learn the ideas, learn how to adapt the AI or anything involving the process. State the people if any & Please be elaborate. Declare self tought if you solved this by yourself. 

i solved this assignment by myself, for the algorithm in the book, i searched in the internet to get the detail information of the algo because the pseudocode isnt that clear. and i found that the slow convex hull is actually called 2d naive, while the fast convex hull is called monotone-chain
